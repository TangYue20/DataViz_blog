# 1. Overview

On January 23, 2014, multiple events unfolded in Abila. Youâ€™ve been asked to come in to perform a retrospective analysis based on limited information about what took place. Your goal is to identify risks and how they could have been mitigated more effectively.

You have access to a single data stream containing two major sources:

Microblog records that have been identified by automated filters as being potentially relevant to the ongoing incident
Text transcripts of emergency dispatches by the Abila, Kronos local police and fire departments.
From this data, can you evaluate the changing levels of risk to the public and recommend actions?

You also have access to maps of Abila and background documents as well. (Note: these are the same materials provided in Mini-Challenge 1 and Mini-Challenge 2).
